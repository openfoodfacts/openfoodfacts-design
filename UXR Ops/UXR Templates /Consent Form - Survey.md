# Templates for the survey 

**Tool: Google Form**

The consent checkbox at the very beginning of the form, right after the data protection summary and privacy notice link, makes it a required field so participants can’t proceed without giving consent. 

Here’s a quick outline of how the top of your Google Form Survey should look:

# How to Collect Consent for Future Contact at the End of the Survey
