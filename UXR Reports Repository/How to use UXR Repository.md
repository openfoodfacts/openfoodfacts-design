# 📘 How to use UXR Repository

This repository is a centralized space for storing, organizing, and accessing user research insights. 
It is designed to help teams make evidence-based decisions throughout the product development process.


# 📝 How to Write a UXR Report Title

Every research entry in the repository should have a clear, consistent, and descriptive title. 
This helps teammates quickly understand the focus of the research and find it later through search or filters.

Time: [YYYY Q] Name of The Project: Topic 

For example: [2025 Q2] Open Prices: Onboarding Flow 

🚫 Avoid:
- Vague titles like “UX Report” or “Research Findings”
- Overly long or complex titles
- Missing dates or context


# 🏷 How to Tag in the UXR Repository
