📅 Date: 17.07.2025 

**🎯Foundation Phase 1: Expert & Contextual Understanding**

Method: 

[UX Audit](https://www.figma.com/board/gPtsX2q0ZF6WElF7YSAYjz/Open-Prices---UX-Audit?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=O3PVYKJISqT489NZ-0) 

[Heuristic Evaluation(based on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability principles)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcEp9b5-WQlBL6M_BNHSUBdPZpA7MtYdfBfSzsl4Wts/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.rvtq0jyhzdql)

🧪**Hypotheses to validate (confirmed/rejected, needs further data):**

1. The "add prices" flow violates UX heuristics (confirmed)
2. Stakeholders believe that the process is too long or too complex for casual users.
3. Only a small segment of users are actively contributing (95% are casual contributor)
4. Stakeholders assume that users are confused by the flow for adding prices
5. Users are hesitant to upload receipts because they are concerned about exposing personal data
6. We believe that certain user segments may exist, including: early adopters - tech-savvy, individuals (using the API), power users - researchers.
7. We believe power users mostly want to contribute massively to the database.
8. Stakeholders believe most of our current contributions come from price tags (photos of shelves).
9. For users price per unit is a decision aid not just a data point.
10. We believe users might be afraid of mass upload of proofs due to the GDPR reason 



 
 
**🎯Phase 2: Exploratory Discovery**
- Method: User Interviews (5-8 participants)
- Output: proto-personas, list of JTBD and pain points

**🎯Phase 3: Quantitative Validation**
- Method: Survey (quantitative JTBD outcome validation) (n=50-100)
- Output: validated JTBD importance and satisfaction, finalised personas + segmentation data

**🎯Phase 4: Evaluative Research**
- Method: Usability Testing (n=5-8; each persona test based on their likely task flow)
- Output: UX issues, pain points, design recommendations

**🗂️Deliverables:**

- Research report (key insights, quotes, patterns)

- Prioritized list of JTBD outcomes (with importance/satisfaction data <-- survey)

- Personas

- UX usability findings and pain points

- Recommendations
